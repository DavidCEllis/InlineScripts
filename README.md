# Inline Scripts #

A collection of scripts for various tasks that use Python 
[Inline script metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata)
to declare dependencies as originally specified in PEP-723.

The zipapps folder includes zipapp bundles that do not require the user to have
a tool to run scripts with inline dependencies. (They do still require
a connection to download the dependencies)

## How to use .py scripts ##

These scripts are written to be used with the ducktools.pyz zipapp bundle available
from [here](https://github.com/DavidCEllis/ducktools-env/releases/latest)
